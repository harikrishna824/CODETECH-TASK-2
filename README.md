Creating a Python program to track and manage student grades is a practical project that helps you understand data structures, input/output operations, and basic data processing. Hereâ€™s an overview of how to create a student grade management system.

### Project Overview

**Objective**: Build a program that allows users to input grades for different subjects or assignments, calculate the average grade, and display the overall grade along with additional information like the letter grade or GPA.

### Steps to Create the Student Grade Management System

1. **Define Functions**:
    - Functions for adding grades.
    - Functions for calculating average grades.
    - Functions for determining letter grades.

2. **Display Menu**:
    - Display a menu for the user to select actions such as adding grades, viewing the average, and exiting the program.

3. **Get User Input**:
    - Prompt the user to input grades for different subjects or assignments.
    - Ensure that the user input is valid (i.e., numerical grades).

4. **Calculate and Display Results**:
    - Calculate the average grade.
    - Determine and display the letter grade based on the average.

5. **Repeat or Exit**:
    - Allow the user to perform another action or exit the program.
